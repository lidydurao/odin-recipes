        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb <i>(450 grams)</i> spaghetti, or other long pasta</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4-5 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried chili flakes, or to taste <i>(or 3 fresh chillies)</i></li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more to serve <i>(optional, if you don't keep it vegan)</i></li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to the boil and add spaghetti. 
                Cook until al dente: the spaghetti is soft but still has a little bite.</li>
            <li>While the spaghetti is cooking make the sauce: If you don't use dried chili flakes, 
                remove the seeds from the chilies and finely chop. Peel and finely slice the garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil gently in a frying pan. Add the garlic and chili and cook gently for a few minutes, or until 
                the garlic is pale gold, which will be enough time for the flavorings to infuse the oil <i>(take care not to burn it!)</i>. 
                 Stir in chopped parsley</li>
            <li>Drain the spaghetti still "al dente", reserve 1/2 cup cooking water.</li>
            <li>Add spaghetti to the frying pan, stir well to coat with the oil, add some starchy cooking water, 
                as much as needed to ensure the pasta is moist and juicy*.
                <br>Cook on medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring a couple of times.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the spaghetti with extra chopped parsley, and grated parmesan cheese if you don't keep it vegan. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
